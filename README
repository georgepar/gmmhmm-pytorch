# GMM - HMM implementation in pytorch

Work in Progress

Features:

- Pytorch implementation of diagonal covariance and full covariance GMMs
- (WIP) Pytorch implementation of HMM with discrete and continuous (GMM) emissions


## Examples

Currently only GMM implementation is complete. Check `gmm_example.py`


## Attribution

Parts of the implementations are based on the following repos.
